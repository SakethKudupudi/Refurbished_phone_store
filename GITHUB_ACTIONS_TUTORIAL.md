## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a **CI/CD platform** that lets you automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that:
- ‚úÖ Run tests automatically when you push code
- ‚úÖ Build and deploy your application
- ‚úÖ Check code quality
- ‚úÖ Automate repetitive tasks

### Why Use GitHub Actions?
- üÜì **Free** for public repositories
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Runs in the cloud** - no need for your own servers
- üîß **Pre-built actions** - use thousands of community actions
- üîÑ **Integrated with GitHub** - works with PRs, issues, releases

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Workflow**
A workflow is an automated process defined in a YAML file in `.github/workflows/`.

```yaml
name: My First Workflow    # Name shown in GitHub UI
on: [push, pull_request]   # When to run
jobs:                       # What to do
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: echo "Hello World!"
```

### 2. **Event (Triggers)**
Events that trigger workflows:
- `push` - When code is pushed
- `pull_request` - When PR is opened/updated
- `schedule` - Run on a schedule (cron)
- `workflow_dispatch` - Manual trigger
- `release` - When a release is created

### 3. **Jobs**
A workflow contains one or more jobs that run in parallel by default.

```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [...]
  
  job2:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: job1  # Run after job1 completes
    steps: [...]
```

### 4. **Steps**
Steps are individual tasks within a job:
- **Uses** - Run a pre-built action
- **Run** - Execute a shell command

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4           # Pre-built action
  - run: npm install                     # Shell command
  - run: npm test                        # Another command
```

### 5. **Runners**
GitHub provides virtual machines (runners) to execute jobs:
- `ubuntu-latest` - Linux
- `windows-latest` - Windows
- `macos-latest` - macOS

### 6. **Actions**
Reusable units of code you can use in workflows:
- Community actions: `actions/checkout@v4`
- Your own actions: `./local-action`
- Marketplace: https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions

## Your Current Workflows

### 1. Backend CI/CD (`backend-ci-cd.yml`)

**Triggers:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
    paths: [ 'backend/**' ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
```
- Runs when backend code is pushed to `main` or `develop`
- Runs on pull requests targeting those branches

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Checks out your code
2. ‚úÖ Sets up Java 21
3. ‚úÖ Caches Maven dependencies (faster builds)
4. ‚úÖ Builds your Spring Boot app
5. ‚úÖ Runs tests
6. ‚úÖ Generates code coverage
7. ‚úÖ Uploads artifacts

### 2. Frontend CI/CD (`frontend-ci-cd.yml`)

Similar to backend, but for Angular:
1. ‚úÖ Sets up Node.js
2. ‚úÖ Installs npm dependencies
3. ‚úÖ Runs linting
4. ‚úÖ Runs tests
5. ‚úÖ Builds production bundle

## Common Patterns

### 1. Environment Variables

```yaml
env:
  NODE_VERSION: '20.x'      # Workflow-level
  API_URL: 'https://api.example.com'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      DB_HOST: 'localhost'  # Job-level
    steps:
      - run: echo $NODE_VERSION
      - run: echo $DB_HOST
      - run: echo $API_URL
```

### 2. Conditional Execution

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy to production
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    run: ./deploy.sh
  
  - name: Deploy to staging
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    run: ./deploy-staging.sh
```

### 3. Secrets Management

Store sensitive data in GitHub Secrets:
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy
    env:
      API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
      DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
    run: ./deploy.sh
```

**Add secrets:** Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí New repository secret

### 4. Matrix Builds

Test across multiple versions:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        node: [18, 20, 22]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - run: npm test
```

### 5. Caching Dependencies

Speed up workflows:
```yaml
- name: Cache npm dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-
```

### 6. Upload/Download Artifacts

Share files between jobs:
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    steps:
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-output
          path: dist/
  
  deploy:
    needs: build
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-output
      - run: ./deploy.sh
```

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Reusable Workflows

Create workflows that other workflows can use:

**`.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml`**
```yaml
name: Reusable Test Workflow

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      node-version:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      api-key:
        required: true

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}
      - run: npm test
```

**Use it in another workflow:**
```yaml
jobs:
  call-test:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-test.yml
    with:
      node-version: '20.x'
    secrets:
      api-key: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
```

### 2. Composite Actions

Create custom actions:

**`my-action/action.yml`**
```yaml
name: 'My Custom Action'
description: 'Does something cool'
inputs:
  name:
    description: 'Your name'
    required: true
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - run: echo "Hello ${{ inputs.name }}"
      shell: bash
```

**Use it:**
```yaml
- uses: ./my-action
  with:
    name: 'Saketh'
```

### 3. Job Outputs

Pass data from one job to another:
```yaml
jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      version: ${{ steps.get-version.outputs.version }}
    steps:
      - id: get-version
        run: echo "version=1.0.0" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  
  job2:
    needs: job1
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Version is ${{ needs.job1.outputs.version }}"
```

### 4. Scheduled Workflows

Run on a schedule (cron syntax):
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    # Every day at 2 AM UTC
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'
    # Every Monday at 9 AM UTC
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'
```

Cron format: `minute hour day month weekday`

### 5. Manual Inputs

Accept input when manually triggering:
```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Deployment environment'
        required: true
        type: choice
        options:
          - development
          - staging
          - production
      version:
        description: 'Version to deploy'
        required: false
        default: 'latest'

jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying ${{ inputs.version }} to ${{ inputs.environment }}"
```

## Practical Examples for Your Project

### Example 1: Auto-Label PRs
```yaml
name: Auto Label PR

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  label:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/labeler@v4
        with:
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Example 2: Code Quality Check
```yaml
name: Code Quality

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Check for TODO comments
        run: |
          if grep -r "TODO" backend/src; then
            echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Found TODO comments"
          fi
      
      - name: Check file sizes
        run: |
          find backend/src -type f -size +1M -exec ls -lh {} \;
```

### Example 3: Notify on Failure
```yaml
name: Notify on Failure

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: mvn test
      
      - name: Notify on failure
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: '‚ùå Build failed! Check the logs.'
            })
```

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
1. **Use caching** to speed up workflows
2. **Specify exact versions** of actions (e.g., `@v4` not `@latest`)
3. **Keep secrets in GitHub Secrets**, never hardcode
4. **Use matrix builds** for cross-platform testing
5. **Set timeouts** to prevent stuck jobs:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     build:
       timeout-minutes: 30
   ```
6. **Use concurrency** to cancel old runs:
   ```yaml
   concurrency:
     group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
     cancel-in-progress: true
   ```

### ‚ùå DON'T:
1. Don't store secrets in code
2. Don't run workflows on every commit (use paths filter)
3. Don't create workflows that run too long (>60 min)
4. Don't use `pull_request_target` unless you know what you're doing

---

## Debugging Tips

### 1. Enable Debug Logging
Add these secrets to your repo:
- `ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG`: `true`
- `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG`: `true`

### 2. Use tmate for SSH access
```yaml
- name: Setup tmate session
  if: failure()
  uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
```

### 3. Print Context Variables
```yaml
- name: Dump GitHub context
  run: echo '${{ toJSON(github) }}'

- name: Dump job context
  run: echo '${{ toJSON(job) }}'
```
